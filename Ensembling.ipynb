    "While many models were trained, the challenge allows kernel-only submissions which have to run from raw data to test results in 9 hours. While pretrained models can be uploaded, prredictions must be complete within 9 hours (kernel running time). Hence only a subset of models can be used in practice. Therefore, an ensemble model was fit using logistic regression with a high lasso coefficient. This allows for feature selection. Next, the df was restricted to the selected features and fit to a final logistic regression model. This model is saved and used for predicting on the test set. "
